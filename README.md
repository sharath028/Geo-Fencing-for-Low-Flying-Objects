# Geo-Fencing-for-Low-Flying-Objects
Manufactured an innovative Arduino-based jammer that is robust, mobile, and can be controlled remotely from anywhere in the world using GPRS.
Our Indigenous Drone Jamming System
We have developed an indigenous drone jamming system. Our primary goal was to address the prevalence of individual drone jammers by creating a system that effectively prevents flying objects, primarily drones, from trespassing into a designated area.

Multi-Jammer System with Strategic Placement
Our solution involves a network of jammers strategically positioned in a geometric formation to maximize their efficiency in stopping unauthorized electronic flying objects within a restricted airspace.

Simulations and Off-the-Shelf Components
We designed the individual drone jammers and simulated their effectiveness using CST simulation software. Due to budgetary constraints and limited technical expertise, we procured most of the components for the jammers. These components include:
2.4 GHz AV Transmitter (matches the target drone's operating frequency)
5 Watt RF Amplifier (boosts the jamming signal)
Microstrip Antenna (directs the jamming signal)
The system essentially creates a noisy environment within the airspace, disrupting the transmission signal between the drone and its controller. This degraded signal quality prevents the drone from receiving control instructions, causing it to either descend or return to its home location.

In summary, this project successfully developed a cost-effective drone jamming system for restricted airspace protection.
